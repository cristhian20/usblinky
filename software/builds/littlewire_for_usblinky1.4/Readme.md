Littlewire is a piece of software that enables you to talk to a vUSB device from a computer.

For the usblinky project the WS2811 part of it is relevant.

This enables you to connect your usblinky stick and control it from your computer and make it display coloras and animations.

You can make a status notification thing with it, or a timer, or a moodlamp or .. whatever.
